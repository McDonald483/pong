# pong
This code was written by me 1 month after starting to teach myself to code in pygame on python (so it probably isnt the most efficient or best looking).

this is a simple game that immitates the pong game back in the day, it was created for two people to play together.

to play, the left player uses W and S to move the left paddle and the right player uses the up arrow key and down arrow key. 
the points are projected in the top corners and the game ends when one player gets to five points. enjoy!
